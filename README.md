- 👋 Hi, I’m @ap-ds and I'm a data analyst working in the UK transport sector
- 💻 I have plenty of experience working with spreadsheets and love using Excel...
- 👨‍🏫 But I'm on a journey to improve my Python, as I enjoy using it and it's a lot more powerful
- 🧠 I want to expand my Python skills, document and demonstrate them

Welcome to my Github! I hope this will be a live page, so I am aiming to add little projects to it now and then.
